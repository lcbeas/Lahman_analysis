# Lahman_analysis
Using the Lahman database to find interesting insights into trends in Major League Baseball. First project on GitHub. Would love feedback!
1. Looked at how players over the last 15 years improved their OPS%. Condensed analysis to finding the top 50 players who averaged the highest improvement of their OPS from year to year. Only players who played over 7 seasons with 300 at bats qualified for the analysis.
